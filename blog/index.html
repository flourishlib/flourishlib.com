<p>
<em>4/2/12</em>
</p>

<p>
In the next few weeks there are going to be a number of changes to the Flourish project. As you may have noticed, releases have slowed down quite a bit over the past few months as I've found my free time being split between Flourish and my Sublime Text work. Additionally, I'll soon be moving to a new company.
</p>

<p>
Over the past few months I have found that the current infrastructure that Flourish is hosted on is preventing me from allowing others to contribute without giving them full access to my server. Because of this, I've decided it is time to move development and the website hosting over to GitHub. This will allow me to easily permit access to the source code hosting and developers will be able to contribute code via pull requests. Other benefits include moving the class documentation in version control for easier collaboration.

<p>
A frequent complaint among developers dealing with relational database systems is dealing with database migrations. Depending on the size of the data you are working with, that may be the issue, however the syntax and features of <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements vary greatly between database systems. Ive recently added some functionality to Flourish to make <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statements not only more pleasant to work with, but consistent across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server.

<em>5/18/11</em>
</p>

<p>
One week from today, the annual PHP|Tek conference returns to Chicago for the 2011 edition. I'm excited that I'm able to attend this year, and I'd love to meet some Flourish users in person! So, whether you want to ask questions, suggest improvements, or grill me on the finer points of how to over-use regular expressions, I'm down. :-)
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to get in contact will be through Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/flourishlib">@flourishlib</a>. I'll also be available via my personal account, <a href="http://twitter.com/wbond">@wbond</a>, but I'm going to try and keep that to replies. I look forward to meeting you there!

<h2 id="PHPFloatingPointBug"><a href="/blog/PHPFloatingPointBug">PHP Floating Point Bug</a></h2>

<p>
<em>1/14/11</em>
</p>

<p>
Just last week a rather serious denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was found in PHP, affecting versions 5.2.0 through 5.2.16 and 5.3.0 through 5.3.4. The bug, <a href="http://bugs.php.net/53632">#53632</a>, causes PHP to enter an infinite loop when working with the value <code>2.2250738585072011e-308</code> as a floating point number. The simple submission of this value to a site multiple times can easily cause the web server to become unresponsive to users.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that if you are using <a href="/api/fRequest#get">fRequest::get()</a> and passing <code>float</code> to the <code>$cast_to</code> parameter and Flourish r950 or newer, you will be automatically protected from this vulnerability. The value <code>2.2250738585072011e-308</code> will be converted to <code>2.2250738585072012e-308</code>, which resolves to the same floating point value, but does not cause the infinite loop.
</p>

<p>
If you are using an older revision of Flourish, I strongly recommend you use the <code>flourish.rev</code> file in your Flourish directory with the <a href="/docs/BackwardsCompatibilityBreak">backwards compatibility breaks page</a> to upgrade your code to the latest revision.
</p>

<h2 id="TestingAcross12OSes10VersionsofPHPand6Databases"><a href="/blog/60000Tests">Testing Across 12 OSes, 10 Versions of PHP and 6 Databases</a></h2>

<p>
<em>8/4/10</em>
</p>

<p>
Part of the goal of Flourish is to provide a solid library of code to build web apps and websites on top of. Since PHP runs on such a variety of operating systems and many users do not control the server they are installed on, operating system and PHP version compatibility is important. Thanks to recent donations by <a href="http://imarc.net">iMarc</a> and Luke Foreman, the <a href="/docs/Tests">testing setup</a> has been expanded to include OS X 10.6 and Windows Server 2008.
</p>

<p>
With these changes, <a href="/docs/Tests">over 60,000 tests</a> are run with every SVN commit, on a total of 10 different versions of PHP, running on 12 different server environments. All database-related tests are run on the six supported databases, and most are run using each of the 14 supported database extensions against eight different database versions. In situations where Flourish provides a pure-PHP fallback implementation of a non-standard PHP extension, the tests are run both with the non-standard extension loaded and not.
